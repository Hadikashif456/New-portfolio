                <p className="text-2xl md:text-4xl leading-relaxed font-light">
                    I am a creative developer based in Lahore, Pakistan, specializing in building immersive digital experiences.
                    With a background in Computer Science and a passion for design, I bridge the gap between technical engineering
                    and artistic vision. My work focuses on performance, interaction, and minimal aesthetics.
