                        I don’t just write code; I craft digital experiences that live and breathe. My journey started with a curiosity for how things work, which quickly evolved into a burning passion for building systems that solve real-world problems.

                    <p>
                        From training AI models to optimizing complex algorithms, I thrive on the edge of innovation. I see every bug as a puzzle and every project as a canvas. Whether it's analyzing massive datasets or engineering the next generation of intelligent assistants, I bring a blend of technical precision and creative vision to everything I touch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am ambitious, detail-oriented, and always pushing the boundaries of what's possible. Let's build the future, one line of code at a time.
